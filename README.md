## ‚ú® Key Features & Architecture

### **Core HMIS Modules**
Our system is built around key modules to streamline hospital workflows.

* **Patient Management**: Comprehensive patient registration, medical records, and integrated workflows.
* **Department-Specific Systems**: Dedicated dashboards and tools for key departments like **Pharmacy**, **Reception**, **Administration**, and **Doctors**.
* **Financial Management**: Robust systems for billing, payroll, and vendor management.
* **Security**: Enhanced security via **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, ensuring users only have access to what's necessary.

### **New Enhancements**
We've made significant improvements to core functionality.

* **Improved Pharmacy Management**: A specialized module for pharmacy staff with drug inventory tracking, supplier management, and automated expiry date alerts. 
* **Advanced Reception Dashboard**: A streamlined system for patient check-ins, appointment scheduling, and doctor selection based on real-time availability.

## üõ†Ô∏è DevOps & DevSecOps: A Modern CI/CD Pipeline

This project is a practical demonstration of a full **DevOps pipeline**, leveraging open-source tools to automate the software development lifecycle from code commit to deployment.

### 1. **Containerization with Docker üê≥**
Every microservice is packaged into its own **Docker container**. This ensures consistency and portability across development, testing, and production environments. Each service's directory includes a `Dockerfile` that defines its build process.

### 2. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions ‚öôÔ∏è**
Our `ci-cd.yml` workflow automates the entire process.

* **Static Analysis**: The pipeline starts with a `pre_build_security_scan` using **TruffleHog** to scan for secrets and sensitive data before the build even begins.
* **Build & Scan**: The `build_and_scan_images` job builds each service's Docker image, pushes it to Docker Hub, and then uses **Trivy** to scan for vulnerabilities. The build automatically fails if any high-severity issues are detected.
* **Automated Deployment**: A `deploy` job is configured to automatically trigger a deployment to our Kubernetes cluster using **Ansible** upon a successful build and scan.

### 3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform ‚òÅÔ∏è**
The `terraform/` directory contains scripts to provision a local virtual machine using the **Libvirt** provider.

* `main.tf`: Defines the virtual machine's resources (CPU, memory, networking) and uses a **cloud-init** script to configure the hostname and inject an SSH key for secure access.
* `output.tf`: Provides the IP address of the newly provisioned VM.

### 4. **Configuration Management with Ansible ü§ñ**
Our `ansible/playbook.yml` automates the setup and deployment to the VM.

* **Installation**: It checks for and installs **k3s**, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution.
* **Deployment**: It applies all Kubernetes manifest files to the cluster.
* **Rolling Updates**: It uses the `community.kubernetes.k8s` module to seamlessly patch existing deployments with the new Docker image tag, ensuring zero-downtime updates.

### 5. **Orchestration with Kubernetes ‚õµ**
The `kubernetes/` directory contains all the manifests required for deployment.

* **Deployments**: `*-deployment.yaml` files define the desired state for each microservice, including replica counts and container images.
* **Services**: `*-service.yaml` files expose each deployment, enabling inter-service communication.
* **Ingress**: `ingress.yaml` acts as a single entry point, routing external traffic to the correct microservice based on the request path. 
* **Persistence**: `db-pvc.yaml` ensures the database has a **Persistent Volume Claim**, so data is not lost on pod restarts.
* **Secrets**: `hmis-secrets.yaml` securely stores sensitive information like database credentials.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the HMIS up and running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**
* **Operating System**: This setup is designed for a **Linux host** (e.g., Ubuntu).
* **Essential Tools**:
    * **Docker & Docker Compose**: For building and running services locally.
    * **qemu & libvirt**: To create and manage the virtual machine. Install with:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils
        ```
    * **Terraform**: To provision the VM.
    * **Ansible**: To configure and deploy to the VM.
    * **SSH**: A public/private key pair to access the VM.

### **Step 1: Set Up the Local Virtual Machine**
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/HMIS.git](https://github.com/your-username/HMIS.git)
    cd HMIS/terraform
    ```
2.  **Verify your SSH public key**:
    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```
    If this command fails, generate a key pair with `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`.
3.  **Initialize Terraform**:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
4.  **Create and provision the VM**:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    Note the IP address of the VM that Terraform outputs.

### **Step 2: Access the Services**
You have two options to access the services running inside the VM from your host machine.

#### **Option A: Port Forwarding (Recommended)**
1.  Modify your VM's network settings to forward traffic from your host's port 80 to the VM's port 80. This can be done via the Libvirt GUI (`virt-manager`).
2.  Add a line to your host's `/etc/hosts` file to resolve the domain:
    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/hosts
    # Add this line
    127.0.0.1 hmis.local
    ```
    You can now access the application at `http://hmis.local`.

#### **Option B: Reverse SSH Tunnel**
1.  Establish a reverse SSH tunnel to forward requests from your host's port 8080 to the VM's port 80:
    ```bash
    ssh -N -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@<VM_IP_ADDRESS>
    ```
2.  Access the application via `http://localhost:8080`.

### **Step 3: Deploy to the Kubernetes Cluster**
1.  Ensure your VM is running and you have the IP address.
2.  Run the Ansible playbook from your host machine to install k3s and deploy the application:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook ansible/playbook.yml -i <VM_IP_ADDRESS>,
    ```
